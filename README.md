# Project for my course RIA-development with JavaScript  2DV607

```
git clone https://github.com/mn22nw/favovid.git
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
**Description**  
This the beginning of my favovid app.   **OBS!** click home in the menu to get the app to load *see problems* [VIEW DEMO](http://mn22nw.github.io/2DV607/dist/)  
It's a bit messy at the moment, with some code and modules that wont be there later, but I thought I could put it up anyways...

**Whats up next:**  

* Fix navigation (the current menu-link should not be clickable)
* I'm planning on connecting to firebase and get youtubeIds from there instead of json
* Implement log in 
* Use the youtube api instead of just adding iframes. 
* Figure out how to make use of Redux in a good way.

**Problems**  
You have to press home(or the logo) to get the app to load the homepage properly....it changes the path then....not sure how to solve this (I just realised this so I havn't had any time to look into it yet).
